Portfolio for CMU Telling Stories with Data Course :)

# About Me
Hi. I am Jiashun Fang (She/her/hers), Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. I enjoy to discover beauty in the fusion of art and tech, especially interested in non-traditional art that warps and flips typical ideas of aesthetic beauty. Currently, I am an Arts Program Intern at Children's Museum of Pittsburgh. I would like to keep working on program planning and management in art museums after my graduation. Super excited about my Telling Stories with Data Course. Woooohoo!

# What I Hope To Learn
Make cool data visualizations and connect art and data. I also would like to learn how to illustrate data in a stunning but logical way with super simple art. Know how to select an appropriate visuals to display my data is another thing I would like to gain from this class.
