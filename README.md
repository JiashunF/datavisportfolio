Portfolio for CMU Telling Stories with Data Course :)

# About Me
Hi. I am Jiashun Fang (She/her/hers), Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. I enjoy to discover beauty in the fusion of art and tech, especially interested in non-traditional art that warps and flips typical ideas of aesthetic beauty. Currently, I am an Arts Program Intern at Children's Museum of Pittsburgh. I would like to keep working on program planning and management in art museums after my graduation. Super excited about my Telling Stories with Data Course. Woooohoo!

# What I Hope To Learn
Connect art and data. Make cool data visualizations. Select an appropriate visual to display the data. I would also like to learn how to illustrate data in a stunning but logical way with super simple art. 

# Portfolio
Here you can find my data visualizations. Yayyy!

## Data Visualization Critique #2
1. Data visualization for newspaper reader
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="5e3a4968-08ab-4fb9-ba5d-476c66ea4974" data-type="interactive" data-title="Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol Apprehensions"></div><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/5e3a4968-08ab-4fb9-ba5d-476c66ea4974" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol Apprehensions</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

This data visualization is targeted to readers of Los Angeles Times. Some LATimes readers enjoy reading paper newspaper when having breakfast, some can only choose to read app or web version during their commute. I tried to design the visualization which could satisfy both two groups. I chose the horizontal bar chart to display the data and only utilized grey color, from dark to bright, to show the difference among three categories: Unaccompanied Alien Children, Family Units and Single Adults. The horizontal bar chart shows the drastic rise of the total apprehensions from 2017 to 2019. Besides labeling the number of  each of the three categories, I also add the total number at the right side of each bar. Hope could help reader to get the data in the most efficient way.

2. Data visualization for the report
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="57075049-0e9c-4ed1-b295-4024a0041589" data-type="interactive" data-title="ICE BED"></div><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/57075049-0e9c-4ed1-b295-4024a0041589" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">ICE BED</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

This data visualization is ideally to be embedded in the report, on page 9. There is a large paragraph illustrating the current red condition. The data is sufficient, however, it is hard for people to track and understand the data in a glance with this 14-line paragraph. I tried to turn the second sentence to visual. The second sentence would like to let the reader know that there are still some beds waiting for being funded. So I would like to utilized this pictorial graph with the bed icon to show the difference of number\percentage between the funded and unfunded beds. I still chose the grey color because I think color is redundant here. I added a subtitle to let readers have a better idea of the exact number I am talking here. 
P.S. I tended to eliminate the subtitle, but I feel it is hard to show the number in the visualization?
