Portfolio for CMU Telling Stories with Data Course :)

# About Me
Hi. I am Jiashun Fang (She/her/hers), Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. I enjoy to discover beauty in the fusion of art and tech, especially interested in non-traditional art that warps and flips typical ideas of aesthetic beauty. Currently, I am an Arts Program Intern at Children's Museum of Pittsburgh. I would like to keep working on program planning and management in art museums after my graduation. Super excited about my Telling Stories with Data Course. Woooohoo!

# What I Hope To Learn
Connect art and data. Make cool data visualizations. Select an appropriate visual to display the data. I would also like to learn how to illustrate data in a stunning but logical way with super simple art. 

# Portfolio
Here you can find my data visualizations. Yayyy!
