# Final Project

## Part 1
### Outline
As was predicted at the turn of the century, emoji has been widely used on social media and mobile communications. This project will focus on user experience with Emoji, and reaction between Emoji and emotion of the post content on Twitter. According to this project, Emoji designers can have better ideas of popular emojis, which is important for their future creation.

### Structure
1. Introduction 
2. Emoji frequency on Twitter
* All Emoji
* Colored Emoji
* B&W Emoji
3. User habit with Emoji
* The position of Emoji in Twitter posts
4. The relation of Emoji position and tweets’ emotion (positive/negative/neutral)
5. Potential trend of Emoji

### Data
I found an [emoji sentiment data set](https://www.kaggle.com/thomasseleck/emoji-sentiment-data#Emoji_Sentiment_Data_v1.0.csv) on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). The data is in the form of a CSV table, with the Emoji character (encoded in UTF-8), Unicode codepoint, number of occurrences [1..max], position in tweets [0..1], number of occurrences in negative tweets, number of occurrences in neutral tweets, number of occurrences in positive tweets, Unicode name and Unicode block.

For this assignment I will focus on figuring out the sentimental side of Emoji. The Unicode name and block data I might ignore.

### Method and Medium
I started my project with choosing a topic I am interested in, which would be fun. I would like to play wit hthe data first since some of the insightful result needs to be dealt with algorithm. I will build up my story broad with sketch, but the final piece would be done with the digital version. I am thinking about to use Adobe Illutrator or some other tools to make unique graphs.

### Target Audience
Target audience might be the Emoji designers from companies who need the current statistics of emoji usage on one of the largest social media platform, Twitter, to create the Emojis matches user habits..

### Approach to Identifying Representative Individuals to Interview
In this digital age, almost everyone is exposed under the social media. It is easy for me to navigate people around me who could be my target interviewers. I will select them by observing if they use any emojis or other emotion icons in their messages, emails and social media posts. I would be interested in select three interviewers with different levels of obsession with the emojis and emotion icons. It would be fun if I can observe and get feed back from interviews from different age groups, genders and culture background.

### User Research
#### Interview
I really like this part. The three interviewers I have picked are:

* Student, 23, emoji addicter - almost uses emoji for every single text/post.
* Colleague, 33, uses emoji for texts but only sticks to a few, eg. heart, thumb up, etc.
* Parent, 59, seldom use twitter but uses emoji or other emoticons for texts.

My interview questions are:
Could you help me to check the design part to see if it is comfortable to read
What about the data visualization part? Can you get the main idea of the graphs?
What do you expect to know after reading it?
Any other suggestions?

#### Takeaways from the interview
Add more interactive part. It can be interactive chart, survey or multiple choice questions.
Make the project look fun: have emoji background, colorful designs
“Swipe to see more” might not be available on the computer
Computer has a wider screen. Better to sketch and design in horizontal layout

#### Changes Implemented
I will still stick to black and white design, but will try to make it fun. I will figure out how to set some interactive part for readers to play with. "Call to action" is struggling to me. I felt the public might not change their emoji habit after they read my article, however, it still needs to be clearer for what I expect the target readers to get from my article.

For the chart part, I plan to make some unique charts if I have some good ideas. I like the idea how Anne Luther and her group present the data. It is clean and cool.


## Part 3
### Final Data Story

[Final Project: DISCOVER MIND CODE WITH EMOJI](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/discovermindcodewithemoji/index.html)

From the beginning of the project, my intended audience, I was considering them as Emoji designers. When they launch a new series of design, they might need to know the market demand: what kind of Emojis do people like and how they want to use them? However, my mind changed when I moved to the part II of the project. I feel like designers could be part of my targeted readers, but maybe the general public would be more interested in that topic. 

So I made adjustment and redesigned my storyline and redecided the data visualization types, which would match my targeted audience’s taste and expectation. To narrow down the focus, I designed two personas:

Mike, student, 17
Mike has a girl friend, Katie, who is an Emojiholic and uses Emojis almost in every messages. Mike is a bit confused with the Emojis from Katie sometimes - he cannot tell if Katie is happy or not. He even does not know what kind of emoji is suitable to reply her.

Linda, 67
Linda is a old lady who has three grandchildren. Her lovely grandchildren always send her some messages with Emoji but Linda feels hard to know what they want to tell her through the Emoji. Sometimes Linda misidentify their emotion.

The specific thing I designed for my audience is the relaxing content + colorful data visualization with emojis. I learnt a lot of cool visualization type in this course, but like some people mentioned in the class, we need to design the specific graphs for our intended audience - do not throw complicated graphs to people who just need bar charts. My intention for this article is introduce some tips and fun knowledge to them so the function of visualizations here is to support my texts.

For this project, I learnt how to collected the data. I have turned down my original project idea of “AI and Future Work” since I failed to find data set available to the public. This is the first time I try to incorporate almost 1000 lines of data in my project. For some visualization, I could not use the raw data so I needed to reorganize them first and did some calculations. 

I also did sketches for my story board. I feel excited to put the abstract ideas on the floor. That helps me to organize my ideas logically. Then, digitalizing my sketches and prototyping. I like the interview assignment. This is an important step for designers to test their design. Different people have different aspect of view on my design. More suggestions I could get from this part, more holistic and comprehensive project I could make.
