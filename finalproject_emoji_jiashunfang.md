## Final Project Overview

### Part 1: A Project Proposal
#### Outline
As was predicted at the turn of the century, emoji has been widely used on social media and mobile communications. This project will focus on user experience with Emoji, and reaction between Emoji and emotion of the post content on Twitter. According to this project, Emoji designers can have better ideas of popular emojis, which is important for their future creation.

#### Structure
Introduction 
Emoji frequency on Twitter
* All Emoji
* Colored Emoji
* B&W Emoji
User habit with Emoji
* The position of Emoji in Twitter posts
The relation of Emoji position and tweets’ emotion (positive/negative/neutral)
Potential trend of Emoji

#### Data
I found an emoji sentiment data set on Kaggle. The data is in the form of a CSV table, with the Emoji character (encoded in UTF-8), Unicode codepoint, number of occurrences [1..max], position in tweets [0..1], number of occurrences in negative tweets, number of occurrences in neutral tweets, number of occurrences in positive tweets, Unicode name and Unicode block.

For this assignment I will focus on figuring out the sentimental side of Emoji. The Unicode name and block data I might ignore.

#### Method and Medium
I stated my project with choosing a topic I am interested in. Then I searched sources from McKinley website since they have great data for Artificial Intelligence and future workforce. I would also like to get data from Forbes, they recently opened up a section for the topic about artificial intelligence. I will be googling “Artificial Intelligence,” “AI,” “Workforce,” some keywords like that, to get random articles. Hope I could get awesome data resource from that. Sometimes I did not find useful information from an article, but the links and sources in it point me out a new direction. 
Shorthand might be the tool for me to build up my story broad. I have not started to search other useful tools yet, I will keep an eye on to find out if I could get a cooler tool.
I will be focusing on the data part in each article and report first, to find out if the article/report I read has enough effective data I need. If they have sexy data, then I will read the word part to get the detailed information.

#### Target Audience
Target audience might be the Emoji designers from companies who need the current statistics of emoji usage on one of the largest social media platform, Twitter, to create the Emojis matches user habits..

#### Approach to Identifying Representative Individuals to Interview
In this digital age, almost everyone is exposed under the social media. It is easy for me to navigate people around me who could be my target interviewers. I will select them by observing if they use any emojis or other emotion icons in their messages, emails and social media posts. I would be interested in select three interviewers with different levels of obsession with the emojis and emotion icons. It would be fun if I can observe and get feed back from interviews from different age groups, genders and culture background.

#### Interview
I really like this part. The three interviewers I have picked are:
Student, 23, emoji addicter - almost uses emoji for every single text/post.
Colleague, 33, uses emoji for texts but only sticks to a few, eg. heart, thumb up, etc.
Parent, 59, seldom use twitter but uses emoji or other emoticons for texts.
This is an important step for designers to test their design. Different people have different aspect of view on my design. More suggestions I could get from this part, more holistic and comprehensive project I could male.

My interview questions are:
Could you help me to check the design part to see if it is comfortable to read
What about the data visualization part? Can you get the main idea of the graphs?
What do you expect to know after reading it?
Any other suggestions?

#### Takeaways from the interview
Add more interactive part. It can be interactive chart, survey or multiple choice questions.
Make the project look fun: have emoji background, colorful designs
“Swipe to see more” might not be available on the computer
Computer has a wider screen. Better to sketch and design in horizontal layout


#### Changes I plan to make
I will still stick to black and white design, but will try to make it fun. I will figure out how to set some interactive part for readers to play with. "Call to action" is struggling to me. I felt the public might not change their emoji habit after they read my article, however, it still needs to be clearer for what I expect the target readers to get from my article.

For the chart part, I plan to make some unique charts if I have some good ideas. I like the idea how Anne Luther and her group present the data. It is clean and cool.
