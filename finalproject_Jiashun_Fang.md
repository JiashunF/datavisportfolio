## Final Project Overview

### Part 1: A Project Proposal
#### Outline
As was predicted at the turn of the century, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has caused disruptions in many careers. Facing the threat that automation and AI could force around 33 percent of the US’s projected 166 million workforces to change jobs, skill shifts will reshape the workforce of the future.

#### Structure
The current situation of workforce (in different industries? countries?)
The jobs are replaced by AI
	- What kind of jobs?
	- Skill level?
	- Vary among industries?
How can we protect the labor force?
	- Employ paid for training
	- On-the job training
How will the workforce skills change in the future?

#### Data
I would like to collect data from [McKinley](https://www.mckinsey.com) website. They have great data about Artificial Intelligence and [Future of Work](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work) is their topic in their Featured Insight section. 

For explaining how Artificial Intelligence influences the current workforce, I would like to use the data in [Jobs lost, jobs gained: What the future of work will mean for jobs, skills, and wages](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages). 
In this article, there are quite a lot useful data and they have provided some visuals help me to understand it much better.

[Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/skill-shift-automation-and-the-future-of-the-workforce#part%203) would be the resources for me to extract the data for illustrating my last part of the project: How will the workforce skills change in the future. There are great data visualization in this article, but seems the information they provided in each graph is too much for me. Thus I would only extract the part I need for my project.

I would also like to use [Automation and AI will disrupt the American labor force](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2019/02/25/automation-and-ai-will-disrupt-the-american-labor-force-heres-how-we-can-protect-workers/). Here’s how we can protect workers, the article from [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu), to explain how an different organizations to protect the staff members. What kind of service could they provide to the staff they would like to keep? I could use the data in the paragraphs, and also the rough graphs they provided.

#### Method and Medium
I stated my project with choosing a topic I am interested in. Then I searched sources from [McKinley](https://www.mckinsey.com) website since they have great data for Artificial Intelligence and future workforce. I would also like to get data from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/#5d6e42792254), they recently opened up a section for the topic about artificial intelligence. I will be googling “Artificial Intelligence,” “AI,” “Workforce,” some keywords like that, to get random articles. Hope I could get awesome data resource from that. Sometimes I did not find useful information from an article, but the links and sources in it point me out a new direction. 

Shorthand might be the tool for me to build up my story broad. I have not started to search other useful tools yet, I will keep an eye on to find out if I could get a cooler tool.

I will be focusing on the data part in each article and report first, to find out if the article/report I read has enough effective data I need. If they have sexy data, then I will read the word part to get the detailed information.
